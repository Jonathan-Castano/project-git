It didn’t work because when you put a nil inside the array and call it, Ruby will see nil as “False”. This will cause Ruby to get tricked into thinking that nil(which is the .last method he called), although found and grabbed, will come to be false. Ruby will then continue to look at the right side of the or to find a true or false response. Because it’s able to grab 1(the .first method), it will out put that 1.
